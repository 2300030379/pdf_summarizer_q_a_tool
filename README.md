## Technologies Used

Streamlit â€” Web app framework for data apps.

Pillow (PIL) â€” Image processing.

Python 3.8+

## Notes & Limitations

- PDF text extraction quality depends on the PDF content (scanned PDFs might not work well).

- Rate limits on the Cohere API apply; time.sleep is used to respect this.

- Large PDFs are truncated to the first 100,000 characters for processing.

- Summarization is chunk-based for better performance but might still lose some context.
